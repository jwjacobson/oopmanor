# Adventures in OOP Manor:
## *Search for the Lost Object*

### About the project
I'm making a text adventure to deepen and refine my **object-oriented programming** skills. It's been a lot of fun so far and could even be a step toward my goal of eventually creating a roguelike.

In the game, you play an adventurer who just arrived at OOP Manor, looking for the fabled Object. Will you succeed where others failed?

Gameplay is standard for a text adventure: walk from room to room, read descriptions, take and manipulate items, solve puzzles, laugh at my jokes! I don't know how elaborate it will be, but the OOP approach means once the formal groundwork is laid, adding more rooms/items/puzzles will be relatively easy.

The game is not yet playable.

### Prerequisites
At present AOOPM requires only **Python 3**, with no additional packages or dependencies. Specifically, I'm writing it in **Python 3.11.3**. For this reason it should be extremely portable, able to run on any OS supported by Python, whether it be Linux, macOS, Windows, or something more exotic!

### Installation
TBD once I'm further along
