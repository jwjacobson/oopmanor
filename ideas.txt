Hint ghost hints:
'They say that by definition, an Object is that which appears before a Subject.'
'They say that some kind of code is essential to finding the Object.'
'A wise person told me that an Object can only exist if posited by a Subject.'
'They say there is at least one Room in the Manor that you can never visit.'
'They say that certain Rooms are very dangerous.'
'They say you need to light a candle to talk to the Hint Ghost... but you already know that, don't you?'
'They say that certain secrets are hidden outside the Manor.'
'Some say the Object is a myth; others that even if it exists, it is unknowable.'
'They say not everything the Hint Ghost tells you is true... but you don't believe them, do you?'
'They say Alf and Meg surpass all other contractors in ability, knowhow, and disposition.'
'I saw the Object once, but when I tried to pick it up, my hands went right through it. When I went back to where it was, it was gone!'
